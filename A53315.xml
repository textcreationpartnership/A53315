            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the diſpute with the Stage is drawing to an end, ſo it ſeems to go off on Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s ſide, the greateſt numbers
<pb facs="tcp:98177:3"/>
have with him declar'd againſt a Theatre, and thoſe who vindicate the Poets or their Writings, will with their beſt Argument, want the moſt powerful Protection to defend em from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of the Publick. Thus Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity as well as Inclination, forc'd me to ſhelter theſe Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under your Name, that alone can influence the oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to read any thing further on a Controverſy, which they fancy is clear'd entirely in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.

The Soveraign Excellence of your Judgment
<pb facs="tcp:98177:3"/>
will prevail over Faction and Prejudice, and bring the moſt obſtinate Enemies of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma to Temper and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Beauty of your Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us will make 'em aſham'd of their Malice and Ignorance: and when we talk of you they'll readily agree with us, that the Muſes even in this age, have produc'd ſome things both uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſant You'll pardon me, Sir, that while I have your Picture before me, I only view thoſe perfections which are moſt agreeable to my ſubject. That I avoid looking on what is great and wonderful, and turn the proſpect to what is mild and- lovely.

the Glory of your own Nation, the admiration of others, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Majeſty's Courage and Conduct, the beſt ſupport of the Government, in its moſt preſſing exigencies.

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Collier</hi> fancying by the ſucceſs his Book met with, that his Arguments were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable, and that no body wou'd venture to attack him, ſhou'd he go on with his <hi>Views</hi> of the Stage or the Poets, has left off all meaſures in the <hi>Defence</hi> of his firſt Book, ſhewn himſelf in the colours others painted him before, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd as much arrogance as could be expected from one of his extraordinary reſolution. He uſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the word <hi>Ceremony</hi> with a great deall of affectation, has been furniſh'd with ſome expreſſions which look like good breeding; yet tho he boasts ſo much of his manners, he very ſeldom puts 'em in practice. If he has been <hi>plentifully rail'd at in Print,</hi> 'twas becauſe he, and not the Poets was the Aggreſſor, and had he not been proof againſt juſt Cenſure and true Raillery, he would have him down his Arms; at leaſt been on the defenſive part, but he makes a new buſtle, values himſelf on his noiſe, and bewails the ſilence <hi>We ſuffer'd under a great while, 'twas our fault We
<pb facs="tcp:98177:6"/>
began with them no ſooner.</hi> Who he means by <hi>We,</hi> his Readers are at a loſs to gueſs, nor can they imagin how he became priviledg'd to uſe the Royal Stile, but he will be free with Dignities, 'tis his misfortune, and he rather deſerves pity than blame for't. He ſays, ſome of the Stage Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates pretend his remarks on their Poetry were Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the buſineſs, and certainly they have good reaſon for what they pretend. If the Stage is not capable of amendment, why ſuch care to inform the Poets how they may write better? I think they might have ſpar'd their Complaints againſt his Criticiſms, they are ſo weak and impertinent, that I never heard of one Perſon who has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by 'em. 'Tis true, he happen'd on thoſe Plays which are moſt lyable to exception, but has made ſo little uſe of his opportunity, that his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries need not be afraid of his Judgment, for the hurt he can do 'em is as little to be dreaded as the miſchief Mr—s Farces, the <hi>Amphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion, Love in a Nunnery, Caeſar Borgia,</hi> and <hi>Limberham,</hi> have or ſhall do the Age; thoſe things being read by as few People now, as Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s Books will be ten years hence. He has ſhewn the delicacy of his Taſte, by the pieces he choſe to work on; they were little better than Rubbiſh before, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has nicely found out ſome Places more dirty than others, which is very meritorious, and he ought to be proud on't. His friends ſhould have advis'd him to have omitted his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. His Profeſſion, the particular ſqueamiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Conſcience, might provoke him to war with the Lewdneſs and Profaneneſs of ſome
<pb facs="tcp:98177:6"/>
Comedies. 'Twas Commendable in him to begin to reform the Drama, and there was ſcarce an Author who profeſt Writing that way, who had not declar'd for't. Religion had been ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that the Pit itſelf began to be diſguſted. Thoſe who had any ſhame, bluſht at the treatment Virtue met with from our pitiful Writers; 'twas Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s good Fortune to cry out firſt, and he had been much more Happy, if inſtead of declaring for the extirpation of this ſort of Poetry, he had toucht on thoſe faults which were really ſuch, and not made ſome paſſages (innocent in themſelves) guilty, by the meaning he put on'em. If he had directed thoſe Gentlemen who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diverting and inſtructing the Age, to the means of ſucceeding, and not blacken'd 'em as much as lay in his power, without the Ribaldry of <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſgate,</hi> to render 'em incapable of profiting or pleaſing, by giving the world a mean Idea of their Wit, and a frightful account of their Morals. If he had done this, who would not have applauded the attempt? On the contrary, he falls on their Intellects, and diſſects their Plays, Examines 'em as much as he could like a man of Art, and as zealous as he is for the cauſe of Religion, he could not hide his Vanity, and was not ſatisfi'd with being thought a good Chriſtian, unleſs the Town would believe him a Wit and a Critick. It muſt be agreed with the multitude, that he has ſome claim to the firſt of his Pretences, but I queſtion if any body who has the leaſt acquaintance with the <hi>Belles Lettres,</hi> can imagin he is at all qualify'd for the laſt. A man that writes ſo irregular a
<pb facs="tcp:98177:7"/>
ſtile himſelf, is not likely to amend another's Language; and certainly there never appear'd a Book on ſuch a Subject, which he deſign'd, to refine as well as regulate the Theatre, that in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries has been eſteem'd the ſtandard of Eloquence, Cram'd with ſuch rough periods, and huddled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſo many incoherent Metaphors. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this, as little as ſome may think it to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe many have miſtaken the brisk turn of his ſentences for a lively Wit, and his much Eloquence for a fine way of writing. This but not a little aſſiſted him in the ſucceſs his Books found, and the approbation ſome men of ſenſe once gave 'em, and if that part of his Books which is moſt cry'd up is in theſe Dialogues prov'd to be that which leaſt deſerves it, we may hope he will not long deceive the people with his Elegance. The Dialogue is made uſe of, being to be manag'd with more freedom than a regular diſcourſe, and theſe Chapters containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what another might have obſerv'd, had he read the <hi>Short View</hi> and the <hi>Defence</hi> with the ſame application; 'twas not thought neceſſary to be very exact in the form, thoſe of his obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which relate to the ſenſe of Antiquity, and its authority, are anſwer'd by a perſon whoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and good Senſe, will doubtleſs be more than a match for Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s. If he is dealt with ſomewhat freely, let the Readers, eſpecially thoſe of 'em who are extreamly nice in Civility, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that 'tis Mr <hi>Collier</hi> who gave the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> by their Profeſſions and Quality, has never been
<pb facs="tcp:98177:7"/>
ſcrupulous how he ſcandaliz'd his Adverſaries; he has faln on the men, when he ſhould only have attackt their Poetry, a ſort of uſage he condemns them for with reſpect to the Clergy. He ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Jealous of his honeſty, and one would think it being ſo tender a point, he ſhould not have made the ſame errours in his <hi>Defence,</hi> which he was charg'd with in the <hi>Short View.</hi> 'Twas reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to hope there would have been none of thoſe miſcitations and unfair dealings his Complainants urg'd againſt him, and to which he has, 'tis true, ſaid ſomething, but ſo little to the purpoſe, 'tis Charity to call it ſo. He triumphs on the Victory he has obtain'd over Vice, and the helps he has given Conſcience and Modeſty by his diſcovery of the danger of a Stage. He has indeed a peculiar Talent for ſetting <hi>Smut</hi> off to the beſt advantage, and making ſome of our Licentious Writers ſpeak more obſcenity than they ever was guilty of. If the world are oblig'd to him for this, and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ruin their fineſt pleaſure, by pretending 'tis fatal to their Virtue, they ought to give him publick thanks, and take care by their large Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections and Contributions, that he may have no reaſon to repent his opening his Mouth in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But the beſt and moſt valuable part of the Town have other ſentiments of his Performance. They know well enough there were other reaſons for his ſpeaking at laſt, not quite ſo generous as he repreſents 'em; and can ſee, that tho perhaps he ſucceeded in his Chief End, what he made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to it, was nothing but pretence, as will be demonſtrated in the following Pages; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:98177:8"/>
is deſir'd to be favourable to the General Charge made againſt him in this Preface, ſince the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars will be prov'd on him hereafter. I ſhould now give the Characters of the Perſons introduc'd in theſe Dialogues, but I have obſerv'd that in theſe caſes men are us'd to mean of themſelves all that they ſay well of their fine Gentlemen; and the World have been too much ſurfeited with this piece of Vanity. I rather chuſe to leave my perſons and their reflexions to the Candour of the Reader, who will uſe 'em well if he thinks they deſerve it, if not, all that I can ſay for 'em will do them little ſervice.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
               <p>He has found out indeed that his Play ſhould not have been call'd the <hi>Relapſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>Lovelace and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda</hi> are perſons of <hi>Inferiour conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He forgot ſure, that this was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd as a ſecond part of <hi>Loves laſt Shift,</hi> where thoſe perſons are the top Characters in the Play, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he has miſtaken both the Fable and the Moral.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98177:10"/>
be a continuation of that in <hi>the Fool in Faſhion,</hi> where <hi>Lovelace</hi> and <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> are the chief of the intrigue, and the moral be to ſhew, <hi>That when perſons venture too much on the ſincerity of their converſion, and fly too preſumptuouſly into temptation, they expoſe themſelves to the danger we ſee</hi> Lovelace <hi>in, and their Wives to a Revenge which the ſtrongeſt Virtue is only a Guard againſt.</hi> This is the moſt reaſonable, as well as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Examen can be made of the Fable and Moral. <hi>Young Faſhion,</hi> 'tis true, employs a great part of the Plot, and breaks the Unity of Action, but that's all.</p>

               <p>Not at all. He has examin'd the Play according to his opinions, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Fable and a Moral to an Action, which is only an irregular epiſode of one more Important, and runs out on this into ſeveral heads againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Conduct, which his Friends can't think a fair way of arguing; for his Fable and Moral are not the Fable and Moral the <hi>Relapſer</hi> deſign'd,

               <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
               <p>I think Mr <hi>Congreve</hi> has a great deal more Wit, good Senſe, and even Learning than the Author of the <hi>Short View,</hi> at leaſt of that part of Learning which a man would deſire to be maſter of; and that moſt of what he has ſaid againſt him in that Book and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> is groundleſs and malicious.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bev.</speaker>
               <p>What are there no Profaneneſs and Immorality in his Plays, no abuſe of Quality, nor faults in Decency, no Nonſence, nor Extravagancies, which a man of Wit, good Senſe and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought not to have publiſh'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>We have very few men of ſenſe that have not in ſome meaſure or other been guilty of all theſe accuſations, the humour of the Age has tempted too many of 'em to pleaſe it ſometimes againſt their Judgments, and perhaps
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98177:12"/>
their Conſciences; but Mr <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi> has been as little culpable in this as any man. Mr <hi>Dryden,</hi> I hear, confeſſes his errors, 'twere pity to deny him that Liberty. Mr <hi>Congreve,</hi> on the contrary, pleads not guilty, and the world is to determine who is in the right, he or his accuſer.</p>

               <p>It may be you will find yourſelf miſtaken, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> will not have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Advocates for his <hi>Defence</hi> as he had for his <hi>Short View,</hi> and Mr <hi>Congreve</hi> has diverted the Age too much to fear they will not hear what he ſays for himſelf. His Adverſary begins to make it a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Quarrel: he fancy'd that if he ſtuck cloſe to his firſt Principles, he might not be able to encounter a perſon who had ſo long been the favourite of the Town.

not deſign Inſtruction; what touches a mans reputation neareſt is moſt likely to amend him; and ſure one ought not to be afraid of Inſtructing a fool, for fear the world ſhould have an ill opinion of his underſtanding. The Ancients made ſo little account of this, that they did not ſtick at ſhewing their Actors in Masks, repreſenting the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they brought on the Stage, and calling 'em by their names. This would be outrageous in our times; our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Poets have always diſguis'd the Originals of their Copies ſo much, as was neceſſary to make 'em ſee their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and not be diſguſted with the Picture, becauſe too ſingular. Their Characters, whoever gave occaſion for 'em, have always been general, and if a Fop has been ſtil'd a Lord, every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows that the Author did not make him a Fop becauſe he was a Lord, but made him a Lord, to ſhew a man may have a Title and not deſerve it. The <hi>French</hi> have done the ſame, ſo have the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who underſtand Punctilio better than Mr <hi>Collier.

               <p>I want to know what you have ſaid about his <hi>French</hi> Marquis, for he

               <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
               <p>He is always ſo, and generally as much out as he is now. To excuſe himſelf for his error of making a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> a Quality much leſs than a Marquis or Baron in <hi>England,</hi> he tells you, 'tis pretty plain from <hi>Moliere</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who in his <hi>l' Impromptu de Veeſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> makes <hi>Brecourt</hi> ſay to a Marquis, <hi>Mon pauvre Marquis Je te promet Marquis,</hi> which way of ſpeaking Mr <hi>Collier</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms <hi>is not manners unleſs in Equals or Inferiours.</hi> Now every one that reads that Play, will find he's us'd with ſuch familiarity, to ſhew the freedoms his Foppery expos'd him to. <hi>Moliere</hi> made him a Coxcomb before he allow'd the Character to be treated ſo uncivilly; and who thinks himſelf oblig'd to be nice with a Fop. He knew very well how far a man of his quality might be dealt with ſo freely, without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in on decency. This, I ſuppoſe, will not be diſputed. Then for his Authority, to prove the quality of a <hi>French</hi> Marquis below our Marquiſſes or Barons, he ſays <hi>Dorante in another Play treats one of 'em with terms of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98177:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and</hi> Climene <hi>calls him Monſieur</hi> Dorante, is made a Gentleman of good ſenſe, and the Marquis, like the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his quality, one of an affected taſte in Poetry, who thinks Wit and a Title inſeparable, but ſuffer'd himſelf to be impos'd on, by perſons that Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciz'd on every thing without Candour or Judgment. No wonder then that he uſes him as his Equal, in a diſpute where he knew Self his ſuperiour, and ſaw the <hi>Marquis</hi> led away by Fools; and ſure every man of Wit that is a Gentleman, would be as free in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> on the ſame occaſion. The <hi>French</hi> give the ſtile of <hi>Monſeigneur</hi> to none below a Duke, unleſs his Poſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe demands it. This is frequently ſeen in <hi>Balzac</hi> and <hi>Voiture. Balzac</hi> writing to the Marquis of <hi>Montnaſier</hi> ſtiles him <hi>Monſieur,</hi> but after his advancement to the Government of <hi>Alſace,</hi> his addreſs is <hi>Monſeigneur.. Mr St Evremont</hi> in a Letter to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Superſcribes only <hi>a Monſieur de Boquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam,</hi> though the <hi>French</hi> ſtile all their Biſhops <hi>Monſeigneur;</hi> and 'twas not to make a particular Compliment to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> that they call him
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98177:27"/>
My Lord, for 'tis no more than they do by all their Prelates, as well as his belov'd Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> which any one may find in <hi>Voiture or Balzac.</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, 'twere eaſie to prove him in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, from the <hi>French</hi> Academies, or <hi>Richelet</hi>'s Dictionary; <hi>Richelet</hi> ſays on the word <hi>Marquis.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, what <hi>Rapin</hi>'s ſenſe of <hi>Molier</hi>'s meaning was, is agreeable to ours; for <hi>Rapin,</hi> ſays <hi>the Poets, formerly brought only Servants on the Theatre for their Buffoons. But</hi> Molier's are <hi>Marquiſſes and men of Condition.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98177:28"/>
to the Court and Gentry, and not, as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> ſays, the Country Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Court: For no body but our Adverſary would have underſtood <hi>

But the Citizens who live neareſt the Court, were <hi>like our own,</hi> apt to make awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard imitations of their politeneſs, which the Poets us'd then only to ridicule.

Mr <hi>Collier</hi> ſtretches every thing beyond the meaſure the Poets give it, and uſes his old way of confuting thoſe he oppoſes, makes 'em mean what they never deſign'd, and then laſhes them for their meaning. I have given you other examples of this trick of his before, and demonſtrated, I ſuppoſe, pretty plain, that if a Lord and a Fool grow together, he muſt be ſhewn as a Monſter; and the rather, ſince his Quality makes the figure the more ridiculous.</p>

This was ſaid in another preſence than Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s, and the honour her R.

Is not the fury of a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lover, that on the morrow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to hear his Rival has his Miſtreſs in his arms.

A man muſt not be puniſh'd on the Stage for nothing.

The ſame reaſons which I gave for bringing Quality into our Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, will ſerve for thoſe who ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize the Miniſtry. If any perſon makes himſelf the Subject of <hi>Satyr,</hi> let him ſuffer for't to deter others.

'Tis plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough Mr <hi>Collier</hi> ſtands up ſo much for the Clergy, to make a party among 'em to ſupport his pretences; and he deſign'd without doubt to begin the War (which ſome of thoſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve leaſt from the Laity) long to ſee declar'd againſt 'em. The Laity have encroacht too much on their Learning, and this province has lately been too much neglected by many of their Gown, by which means 'tis hardly now to be recoverd out of the hands of thoſe who have made ſuch large acquiſitions in it.

Let Mr <hi>Collier</hi> think what he will of Mr <hi>Congreve</hi> and our beſt Poets, they honour the memory of the late Archbiſhop, Dr <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> more than himſelf, and ſome that we might name.

Bp <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Bp <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> Bp <hi>Patrick,</hi> will ever be eſteem'd in this and all ages for their Piety and Learning. And who of our preſent Biſhops are there, that for their exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Piety and Learning, don't demand as much honour, as for the Seats they hold in the Houſe of Peers.

               <p>They would without doubt be very angry, and the Poets are not to be blam'd for being more afraid of a Kings frown than Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s. Whatever Mr <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi> is for, his Adverſary 'tis plain, is for levelling. If a Gentleman who takes Orders does not loſe his Place with his Title, I hope that of Clerk is not equal with Majeſty. Gentlemen are us'd as freely, and much more ſo than Prieſts, guilty of the ſame diſorders, tho the Quality is the ſame. If a Juſtice of Peace is made a Coxcomb or a Blockhead, I hope 'tis of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that the Prince who gave him
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98177:42"/>
the Commiſſion is affronted, for 'tis not poſſible that a King ſhould know any thing of the perſon he entruſts, who perhaps never did, nor never will ſee the Court, but by information, wherein Intereſt and Party may be concern'd: neither is the Ordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd by ſhewing one of his Clergy a Fool: Kings and Princes are never brought into Comedy, no more are Biſhops; theſe being the heads of the Church, and thoſe of the State, are alike forbidden to be profan'd by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; to ſtrike at them wou'd be to ſtrike at the foundation of both Church and State: but their Subjects and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, of all other ranks, when they can be ridicul'd without offence to the State, or Religion have been and may be expos'd. Mr <hi>Collier</hi> perhaps wou'd be well enough pleas'd if a Parſon was brought on the Stage, provided a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld went before with his Coat of Arms, and made room for his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in figure, with a good grace, and a lofty mien, like the Cardinals in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Borgia;</hi> he wou'd not much value how wicked they were made, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the degree of Clerkſhip was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98177:42"/>
and yet the Poets have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd themſelves ſo warily, that they never dealt with any of 'em above a Vicar or a Chaplain. The Bar-Gown has often been play'd with, and ſhewn in a more deſpicable figure, yet the Lawyers don't think it worth their while to cry out againſt Comedy, as aiming at the ruin of the Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and the Judges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have deſir'd <hi>Love for Love,</hi> with all the faults Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has laid to its charge, to be preſented 'em, and were extreamly well pleas'd with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, tho the Lawyer there makes a trivial appearance.</p>

               <p>This is not the firſt fling he has had at the Theatre, in this Book, which aim'd at its entire deſtruction; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets what he ſaid in the 8th page, or was ſorry for his tenderneſs. Now he tells you, Scipio <hi>pull'd it down,</hi> Trajan <hi>and</hi> Antoninus <hi>diſcourag'd it,</hi> Tiberius <hi>baniſh'd the Stage,</hi> Lewis the Godly <hi>wou'd not endure a Play-houſe, Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>often checkt it. Now theſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98177:43"/>
were moſt of them great Princes, and which is more to the purpoſe, moſt of them good ones too. Thus ſays Mr</hi> Collier. And let any one gueſs if he inſinuates any thing leſs than the ſhutting up the Play-houſe doors for ever. Mr <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi>'s aſſertion may be eaſily vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We never read of any great Prince who complain'd of the Theatre itſelf, ſome may have corrected the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome of the Poets and Actors of their times. The greateſt Princes that ever liv'd have always encourag'd the <hi>Drama;</hi> this is ſo evident, that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is full of the Examples we might inſtance on this occaſion. <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> was ſo paſſionate an admirer of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> that ſtory tells he learnt their Tragedies by heart, and ſung an Epiſode of the <hi>Andromeda</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> at his laſt Banquet. <hi>Pompey</hi> was at a prodigious expence to erect a Theatre, and to ſhew that he was not the more ſoft or more effeminate for his love of pleaſure, 'twas at the ſame time he was enlarging the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and perhaps contriving to make himſelf her Maſter. His Rival <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> has ſhewn what a value he had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98177:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for Plays by the Tragedies he writ himſelf, and the fine encomium he left on <hi>Terence:</hi> Whom as great a <hi>Scipio</hi> as he who <hi>pull'd down the Stage</hi> is ſaid to aſſiſt in writing his Comedies. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> particularly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the Theatre, and thoſe who wrote for't; his affection for <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> the Patron of the Stage, and one who honour'd it with his own pieces, and his intimacy with <hi>Varius,</hi> is an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable proof of this. If <hi>Lewis the Godly,</hi> and ſome other Chriſtian Princes could not endure Plays, they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters reaſons for't than Mr <hi>Collier</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes on 'em. The Entertainments which in thoſe days were ſhewn on the Stage, were ſuch ſtuff as might well offend the ear of a Prince leſs bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted than he was. If our adverſary is acquainted, as without doubt he is, with the wit of thoſe times, he knows their Plays were ſtrange pieces, and not eaſily endur'd. The Holy Father at <hi>Rome</hi> has often ſmil'd on the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets. The honours <hi>Petrach,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Taſſo</hi> receiv'd from him, ſhew that Infallibility cou'd countenance ſome Wits, whoſe Muſes were not the Chaſteſt that ever appear'd. If thoſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98177:44"/>
Authors have left few Dramatical pieces, 'twas becauſe the Stage was not quite recover'd out of the <hi>Gothick</hi> ignorance, which had obſcur'd it for 1400 years. If Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> put down the Booths, and forbid the Drolls in <hi>Grace-church-ſtreet,</hi> ſhe encourag'd thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who writ the regular Plays, and gave Poets and Actors conſiderable Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. 'Tis ſaid too, that ſhe tranſlated herſelf ſeveral Tragedies from the <hi>Greek,</hi> which is demonſtration enough that ſhe was a Friend to the Theatre. Mr <hi>Collier</hi> himſelf knows the only <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> that has honour'd the Chriſtian Religion with his ſufferings for theſe thouſand years, was very kind to the Stage and the Poets, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for't, not to mention his Sons, whoſe Memories I'm ſure are dear to Mr <hi>Collier.</hi> His preſent Majeſty, when he has been at leiſure to divert himſelf from the great Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> has commanded ſeveral of our Comedies to be preſented him by his Servants in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and has ſeen <hi>Racine</hi>'s Tragedies in <hi>Holland</hi> with ſatisfaction. And all the world knows her late Majeſty of Glorious Memory, was very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98177:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Theatre, honour'd it often with her Preſence, and rewarded boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſome of our Comick Writers. Beſides, the Drama has been encourag'd ev'n by Commonwealths as well as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs in <hi>Athens,</hi> let Mr <hi>Collier</hi> ſay, what he will of the Sentiments of that Republick, ſpent more Money in the decorations of her Theatre, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding thoſe who ſucceeded there, than in all her Wars, if we may give credit to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who you will allow as good an authority as the <hi>Short Viewer, &amp;c.</hi> Neither did this wiſe people, as a learned Author comments on <hi>Plutarch,</hi> believe their Expence unprofitable, ſince 'twas to inſpire their people with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conformable to the publick good.</p>

Sometimes they condemn'd the <hi>Platonic</hi> Philoſophy, and then the <hi>Ariſtotelian,</hi> the one was damnable at one time, and the other at another, one encourag'd and recommended by ſome Fathers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd and forbidden by others. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> and ſome more of 'em fell into dangerous errours by their ſtudy of <hi>Plato,</hi> whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſtiles the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Hereſies of thoſe times.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98177:49"/>
force, otherwiſe of none, their ſayings may be reflected on as well as ours, and are as lyable to exception. The ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has made from 'em, and their weight, will be examin'd by a perſon, who, I hear, has apply'd himſelf to ſtudy this matter with care and induſtry. For my part, I take leaſt notice of his ſenſe of Antiquity, I look on things as they appear now, and if there is nothing to be ſaid againſt 'em at preſent, and much for them, had the Fathers, without warrant from Scripture, thunder'd more againſt 'em than the moſt zealous of them did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctrine of the Antipodes, I ſhould not be byaſs'd by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

Yet I am of opinion, he has ſhewn himſelf not very knowing ev'n in his own way. Obſtinacy is generally the Companion of error in Religion; a man that has a miſtaken Conſcience, often firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he's in the right, and dies in that belief. A wicked man knows his own guilt but has not Grace enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or deſire to be better. Strong perſwaſion may inſpire him with a fear of puniſhment, and convince him of the danger of his ways: Such a one is certainly more likely to be converted to the true Religion, than one who thinks his is the true, and will not hearken to any other, whereas a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man can't ſuppoſe he's in the right, whatever he ſays or practiſes; and there's more hopes of the Converſion of a lewd Fellow, than a Quaker to the Orthodox Faith.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98177:59"/>

'Tis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt criminal to have ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite skill in the knowledge of Evil, as to extract it out of the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent things, as Spiders ſuck Poyſon out of Flowers.

               <p>To ſay the Apoſtles were Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, is a boldneſs which will ſtartle many good Chriſtians, and which the Church itſelf would ſcarce countenance.

               <p>There is no equality in the compariſon, a Judge as one of the heads of the Law, the Lord Mayor as the head of the City, ought not to be ſhewn ſcandalous, tho Judges and Lord Mayors too have been brought on the Stage, in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's Reign. But a man with a Bar-Gown
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98177:66"/>
and Livery-Gown, has not the ſame priviledge. There's no fear of making the Law or the City contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible that way, if Citizens and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers take care by their actions not to give the world other reaſons for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em ſo. The Houſe of Lords is one of the States of the Kingdom, and to jeſt on 'em is certainly the higheſt breach of manners, but every Lord in private and out of his Robes has not the like pretences to exception from ſcandal, if he's the ſubject on't. 'Tis time to have done with this diſpute, we have had it over and over again in ſo many places, that 'tis as tireſome to vindicate the Poets, as to read Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s Charges againſt 'em, on the affair of ceremony, which the worſt of 'em is as good a Judge of as himſelf.</p>

               <p>If Rewards and Puniſhments ought to be apply'd, the Guilt as well as the Merit ought to be expos'd. A man muſt not be condemn'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor can the Audience judge of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98177:66"/>
the Crime without hearing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment. The man muſt appear wicked, before he can be puniſh'd for his wickedneſs; and how can he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo but by his words and actions. If he is lewd in one, the Adverſary ſays he's not to be ſeen for his <hi>ſmut.</hi> If in the other, 'tis breach of Manners and Decency. 'Tis very ſevere uſage, if a Poet muſt bring on a perſon purely to puniſh him, and not let the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence know how he has deſerv'd it. Mr <hi>Collier</hi> owns Rewards and Puniſhments ought to be apply'd, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence contradicts all that he has ſaid about Character and Manners. If the Poet does not correct vitious men, he errs in the Conduct of his Play, and there's no excuſe for him. If he does, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> ſays 'tis his duty. The main difficulty is, how it muſt be done not to offend him. He muſt be brought on the Stage and ſome one tell the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, (as the <hi>French</hi> knock their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Hero's on the head) That the poor fellow has been very wicked behind the Scenes, and is brought out to be manag'd for't, but not a word of his lewdneſs; which is much like, as if
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98177:67"/>
a Jury ſhould give their Verdict on a Criminal without hearing the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt him. A perſon well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough known had lately been very much oblig'd, if the Court would have ſentenc'd him, and not order'd his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation to be read, but they did not think fit that Juſtice ſhould yield to Decency. And perhaps the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Trial, has been as preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the age, as the moſt vitious Play which ever was acted, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand people having by this means been inform'd of a Crime, which till then they had never heard of; and yet Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice thought the ill conſequence of ſpreading that paper, would not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the advantages the people might reap by being deterr'd from ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a villany, when they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with its puniſhment.</p>

The truth of our Doctrine is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, that there never was in our Nation an Atheiſt, but in affectation, or one whoſe Debauches made him deſire his Creed might not be true: And this is the reaſon. Why when a Liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was ſuch a thing as an Atheiſt.</hi> And I ſhould bluſh for the Adverſary when he asks ſuch impertinent Queſtions, but that I hope when he reads 'em again, he'll bluſh for 'em himſelf. He's the firſt Divine that ever made a doubt of the Libertines believing againſt their practice, or that indeed 'twas poſſible for a man to be born in Chriſtendom, and be an Atheiſt from his Soul. The Faith of many may be very ſceptical and uncertain; there may be ſome who have ſcruples concerning revelation, tho of thoſe who pretend to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, not one in a thouſand thinks as he talks; but a real Atheiſt is a monſter, which no body ever met with beſides Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> and I hope he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got himſelf when he ſeem'd to imply that a man may be bred in <hi>London,</hi> and yet ſpeak his mind when he denies the being of a God.

               <p>I believe he did know what he was about, and I hope I ſhall convince you that I am not too ſevere with him, for ſaying ſo in page 209 of the <hi>Short View,</hi> he tells you, <hi>he'll ſpend ſome more thoughts than ordinary on the</hi> Relapſe, <hi>and examins briefly the Fable, the Moral, and the Characters.</hi> The Fable he ſays, he takes to be as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

               <p>He tells you here, he was not examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moral, and in his <hi>Short View</hi> he was. He agrees mightily with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; however, this we ll excuſe in him. If that is the Fable of <hi>Virtue in danger,</hi> the Moral of the Play muſt neceſſarily riſe from it, and be in part what he ſays it is, how then can he ſay that he did not examine the Moral, when he lays down what the Fable is ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. They are inſeparable, and he could not talk of one without implying the other. A Play can't have two Actions and two Morals regularly, but ſome underplots (as we call them) are by many inexperienc'd writers ſpun out to the length of the main action. This Mr <hi>Collier</hi> miſtook, as I told you at firſt, wilfully or ignorantly, and thence very preſumptuouſly affirm'd the Play is miſcall'd. This he is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of, and would diſown, but he did examine the Moral in examining the Fable, and to read the Page I have cited, will be enough to ſatisfie you far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his own words.</p>

diverſion; and Religion is in this, as in all other popular caſes, made the Inſtrument of their Reſentment, while to ſpeak truth, their Intellects are more injur'd than their Conſciences.

he approv'd of ſome things of <hi>Menander</hi>'s, and countenanc'd the Comick Writer, by ſerving himſelf of his words in the Law he was to deliver to Chriſtians.

               <p>They are no more condemn'd, than the immoderate uſe of any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſure, or the abuſe of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of Converſation. When Plays are guilty of Blaſphemy or Lewdneſs they are forbidden, becauſe Blaſphemy and <hi>Smut</hi> (as he's reſolv'd to call it) are condemn'd in general; and if a man can't talk without talking lewdly, he is not allow'd to talk at all; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'twould be extravagant enough to infer from thence, that talking is a ſin. You muſt remember he ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he was for <hi>Innocent Diverſions,</hi> (ſpeaking of the Stage) and elſewhere, that <hi>ſingularity, cowardice,</hi> &amp;c. might do; and yet here he affirms, <hi>that Plays
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98177:76"/>
are plainly condemn'd in Scripture.</hi> If ſo, thoſe Diverſions can't be innocent, neither can Cowardice, Singularity, Covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do on the Theatre; and thus he's for Diverſions which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture condemns. Thoſe parts of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which Holy Writ condemns, are things which are every where unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and their coming from the Stage would not make 'em ſo, if they had not been ſo before. He is not long in the ſame humour, ſometimes for a Drama, ſometimes for none, but I hope in a little while no body will much matter what he's for, ſince men of the beſt ſenſe and beſt Morals that have writ this age, allow and commend theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments. <hi>La Bruyere,</hi> whom we can't quote too often, being a much more valuable Author than Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> or the Bp of <hi>Meaux,</hi> has frequently ſpoke well of a regulated Stage, and ſeems to wonder how 'tis poſſible that ſo fine a recreation ſhould be made ſo uſeleſs, as 'thas been in the hands of the Modern Poets.</p>

               <p>But when they are innocent, as moſt of <hi>Corneille</hi>'s and <hi>Racine</hi>'s Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are, and ſome of <hi>Moliere</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, they are as warrantable from the ſilence of the Scriptures as all other diverſions.

               <p>I'll tranſlate it as well as I can, at leaſt I will give you his meaning. Some ſcrupulous Sparks had got the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> to forbid his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the Stage. <hi>Tartuff</hi> being a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, who, to anſwer the Character, ſpoke abundance of good things, at the ſame time that the audience knew him to be a Raſcal. This <hi>Moliere</hi> thought allowable, and that he err'd in t no more againſt his Religion than his Art, but the <hi>Colliers</hi> of thoſe days were not of his opinion, they cry'd aloud againſt the wickedneſs of the Author, and prevail'd with the <hi>Good Biſhop</hi> to command, that it ſhould not be repreſented. The caſe is the ſame with ours, and the Preface one of the beſt I ever ſaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I know very well what theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſay in anſwer to this, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate that the Theatre ought not to meddle with ſuch matters. I ask under favor, where they learnt this fine propoſition, which they only ſuppoſe, and can in no wiſe prove. On the contrary, it may without queſtion be demonſtrated, that the Drama had its riſe from Religion, and was
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98177:77"/>
a part of its Myſteries. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> our neighbours, ſeldom celebrate a Feſtival without ſome Theatrical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and even amongſt us we derive its Birth from a Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to whom the <hi>Hotel of Burgundy</hi> at preſent belongs. This place was ſet a part for repreſenting the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Myſteries of our Faith; and there are Dramatical pieces now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, in <hi>Gothick</hi> Characters, written by a Dr of the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> What need have we to go ſo far, are not at this time Monſieur <hi>de Corneille</hi>'s Religious Pieces ſhewn there with univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If the buſineſs of Comedy is to correct the Vices of Mankind, I know no reaſon why any one ſhould plead priviledge. This Vice <hi>(Hypocriſy)</hi> is much more dangerous in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences than any other, and we have ſeen the Theatre very ſucceſsful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. The moſt excellent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of Morality, are often leſs power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the ſtrokes of Satyr. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reproves the greateſt part of Mankind more than painting their defects.</q> 
                  <q>'Tis a great mortification to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98177:78"/>
Vice to be expos'd to the laughter of the world. One can eaſily enough bear with reproof, but can't endure raillery, and moſt men had rather be thought wicked than ridiculous. I am accus'd of putting Phraſes of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into the mouth of my Impoſtor, and how could I have drawn the Character of a Hypocrite without it. 'Tis enough, I think, that I let the Audience know the guilty motives which induc'd him to ſpeak ſuch things; and I have forborn other conſecrated terms which I thought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body would not care to hear put to an ill uſe. But in the Fourth Act he delivers a pernicious Moral. Has not the world heard it often repeated? Is there any thing new in my Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? And is there any reaſon to fear that a thing ſo univerſally abhorr'd, ſhould make an impreſſion on their minds? Have I made it dangerous by bringing it on the Theatre, or given it an authority by putting it in the mouth of a Villain. Sure there's no likelihood of that, and the Age ought either to approve the Comedy of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuff,</hi> or condemn all Comedies. This
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98177:78"/>
is what ſome perſons lately have fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly aim'd at, and the Theatre was never before ſo violently attackt: I can't deny but ſeveral Fathers of the Church have condemn'd the Stage; however, it muſt not be deny'd too that many of them have handled this ſubject more tenderly. By which means their authority is divided, and ruin'd by the diviſion. All that can be drawn from this diverſity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in perſons inlightned by the the ſame Revelation is, that they have judg'd differently of the Drama. The one conſider'd it in its purity, the other in its corruption, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe filthy ſhews, which were indeed beaſtly repreſentations. In ſhort, ſince we ſhould diſcourſe of things, and not of words, and the greateſt part of the oppoſition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from miſunderſtanding, we need only draw the Curtain, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Stage as 'tis in itſelf, to ſee whether 'tis really condemnable. Without doubt, every one knows that Comedy is only an ingenious Poem, which by pleaſant Leſſons would correct mens faults. How then can it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98177:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be cenſur'd but with injuſtice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if we ſhould hear what Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſays on this ſubject, we ſhall find the moſt famous Philoſophers have ſpoke in praiſe of the Theatre, even thoſe who profeſs the ſevereſt wiſdom, and were inceſſantly crying out againſt the Vices of the age they liv'd in. We ſhall find <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd a great deal of time about the Drama, and took care to reduce the method of writing Plays into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Art. We ſhall find that the greateſt Heroes, and men of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Dignity, have thought it glorious to write them, and ſome who have not diſdain'd to act in publick what they compos'd in private. That <hi>Greece</hi> made the Eſteem ſhe had for this Art illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, by the vaſt expence and the Superb Theatres ſhe honour'd it with, and that the ſame Art receiv'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>Rome</hi> extraordinary incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. I don't mean in <hi>Rome,</hi> debaucht under the liberty of her Emperors, but <hi>Rome</hi> when ſtrict in diſcipline under the wiſdom of her Conſuls, and when the <hi>Roman</hi> Virtue was in its vigour. I own there has

been a time when the Drama was corrupted. And what is there in the world free from Corruption? There's nothing, be it never ſo innocent, which men have not made Criminal. No art ſo wholeſome, whoſe good intentions they have not revers'd. Nothing ſo good in its ſelf, which they have not abus'd by putting it to an ill uſe. Phyſick is an uſeful Science, and every body reveres it as one of the moſt excellent things we have among us. However, there was a time when 'twas odious, and has often been made uſe of in the Art of poiſoning. Philoſophy is a gift of Heaven: 'Twas given us to raiſe our Souls to the knowledge of a God, by contemplating what is wonderful in nature. Yet we are not ignorant that it has frequently been put to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes, and publickly employ'd in ſupporting Impiety, even the moſt holy things have not eſcapt humane corruption. We ſee Villains every day abuſing Piety, and making it a means to bring about their wicked deſigns; but we can diſtinguiſh as we ought the men from their Profeſſion.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98177:80"/>
We don't mingle in a falſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the goodneſs of the thing corrupted, with the malice of the Corrupter. We ſeparate always the ill uſe from the intentions of an Art, and as we don't think fit to forbid Phyſick, becauſe 'twas once baniſh'd from <hi>Rome</hi> nor Philoſophy, for being publickly condemn'd in <hi>Athens,</hi> ſo we ſhould not condemn the Stage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe 'twas cenſur'd at a certain time; there were reaſons for that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which have no foundation now. I know there are ſome men of ſenſe, <hi>(continues he a little farther)</hi> who are ſo nice, that they can't ſuffer any Plays whatever, who ſay, that thoſe which are moſt honeſt are moſt dangerous, that the paſſions the Poets paint are the more hurtful, the more virtuous they appear, and that the Soul is too much ſoftned by ſuch Repreſentations. I don't ſee where's the harm, if a man is ſoftned at the ſight of an honeſt paſſion. I own the degree of Virtue to which they would mount us by their extraordinary inſenſibility, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exalted, but I queſtion if Humane Nature in her own ſtrength is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98177:80"/>
of ſuch perfection; and if 'tis not better to endeavour to rectify and ſweeten humane paſſions, than quite extirpate them. I allow there are places which perſons ſhould chooſe rather to frequent than the Theatre; and if every thing is blameable which does not directly relate to God and our Salvation, Plays certainly ought not to be ſuffer'd, nor would we be ſorry to ſee them condemn'd with the reſt. But ſuppoſing (what is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true) that Religious Exerciſes ſhould have ſome intervals, and men want recreation, I maintain none can be made more innocent than Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</q>

I'm ſure he has not made himſelf an enemy, by affronting the Theatre, who wou'd not ſerve the King and Kingdom with every thing which depends on him; and 'tis hard that a man who is the Poets enemy becauſe they are friends to the Government, ſhou'd be ſuffer'd to triumph over them, as he does in all places where his merit

               <p>Well Gentlemen, to have done with the News-monger, what think you after all that Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has ſaid,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98177:85"/>
is there no neceſſity of a Reformation in the Stage, muſt the Play-wrights be ſuffer'd to go on with their abuſe of Magiſtracy, Morals and Religion, and tho Mr <hi>Collier</hi> may have err'd in ſeveral things, is he not in the right in the main?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Beau.</speaker>
               <p>I can't tell that, and am loath to give my opinion of reforming the Drama, till I am ſure the world will be ſatify'd with that: Whatever errors our Comick Writers have been guilty of, their Enemies have not yet hit on 'em, at leaſt on any of the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. 'Tis not in their power to ruin 'em but by noiſe and force, and thoſe who love their pleaſure as well as I, are in the wrong to give their Enemies any advantages over 'em, or put wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in their hands to hurt them. If the Stage ought to be corrected, the men of ſenſe can only put us in a way, and they will not ſet about it while there are ſuch powerful Parties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring for no Plays at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bev.</speaker>
               <p>I am not one of 'em, and ſhould be glad to ſee ſome method propos'd to keep up both Houſes, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the virtue of their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98177:85"/>
and I love their Entertainments too well to be willing to part with 'em, if they can be maintain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to Manners or Conſcience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Beau.</speaker>
               <p>Which certainly they may, none ever doubted the contrary, that was able to judge in this Affair, and thoſe who attack this ſort of Poetry, will afterwards find exceptions againſt the Muſes in general. Muſick will next offend 'em, and every one that has not a good ear or a tolerable judgment in the art, will cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the danger of Fiddles and Haut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bev.</speaker>
               <p>That will be ſevere indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Beau.</speaker>
               <p>I think the other is much more ſo. Muſick affords all its admirers a wonderful delight, when they are truly touch'd with it; yet this delight goes no farther than an amuſement for the preſent. Whereas at a Dramatical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation the paſſions are wrought up ſo forcibly, and the Images appear ſo lively, that the Impreſſions ſtick on the Audience, and may be advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them in their Conduct in the world. 'Tis ſtrange, the Sages are ſo angry with the Theatre; are not there
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98177:86"/>
an hundred other Diverſions more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to a mans health and fortune? No body attempts to ſhut up our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern doors, and yet without all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſpute, they give occaſion to much more Extravagance, Immorality, and Debauchery, than the Play-houſes are charg'd with. The Stage aims at bringing men to their ſenſe, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns aſſiſt them to loſe the little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they have; and yet they are ſo neceſſary in Commerce and Society, that 'twould be monſtrous to talk of prohibiting Wine, becauſe ſome Scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers have been hang'd for their drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en frolicks. Beſides, a Bottle is a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, a Blockhead can drink as much as a man of Wit, and in moſt of thoſe converſations, if there is any more reſpect paid to one than another, he that carries off moſt Claret is the greateſt man. The <hi>Wife and Great</hi> are ſometimes refreſh'd, and can debauch in the Taverns without ſcandal, but at the Theatre they would be ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and when they are there, they are not treated ſo tenderly as to engage their good word. Gaming, which has ruin'd a thouſand Families of the beſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98177:86"/>
Extraction, made great numbers of Gentlemen Beggars, and tempted ſo many of the fair to very odd exceſſes to ſupport themſelves under their ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is a Vice which every one rails at, but no body attempts to get rid on't.</p>

Beſides, ſuch a Director would ſoon be weary of his Poſt, he muſt deal with a people who will not part with a tittle of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings without very good reaſon, which you will imagin when you hear that one of them has offer'd a Finger for half a Page, and a Limb for a whole one, and a man may not be willing or able at all times to give a reaſon for his Criticiſm.

He comes to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, reſolv'd to treat it as a thing which has affronted him, and 'twill be hard for the Poets to have their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for their Judge. Let thoſe be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Stage, whoſe right it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was to command it, and to whom 'tis natural for the Authors to ſubmit. If they have ſpar'd 'em too much, their own Maſters may caution 'em to the contrary, who, with a little care, may reform our dramatical repreſentations, eaſier and ſooner than any new ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers.</p>

               <speaker>Beau.</speaker>
               <p>I hope all ſuch pieces will meet with ſuch treatment. The fault is more in the Poets underſtanding than their Morals, and their Audiences are more defective in their taſte of Wit, than their approbation of Vice. When the Town ſhall not be pleas'd with extravagant thoughts, irregular ſcenes, incoherent metaphors, wild rants, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous characters, unnatural images, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid as well as brutal humours, Vice, Immorality, and Profaneneſs, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear no more at the Theatre. When the ſenſeleſs Ballads of one Writer, the impertinent brisk Dialogues of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the inſufferable Fuſtian of a third, the <hi>Alſatian</hi> Converſation, and mean rakelly ſentiments of a fourth, the confus'd independent ſcenes of this author, the grimace and poſtures of that ſhall be hiſt off the Stage, Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s <hi>ſmut,</hi> ill manners, and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will vaniſh: Then good Senſe, true Wit, fine Humour, delicate Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and polite Converſation, will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their place: Then Fools will be expos'd to be laught at, and not to be imitated: Hypocrites will appear in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious colours, to adorn the Character
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98177:91"/>
of truly Religious, and ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Knaves will make on the Stage no better figure than they do at the Bar. 'Tis a difficult task for the Poets to take their pictures from nature, and yet to give 'em a turn that may at once delight and in ſtruct. The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Farce could never reach this: they have all along been clapt for their wry mouths and apiſh Geſtures. Their Audiences have laught at their folly, they miſtook it for liking their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and this they have call'd <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and taking.</hi> Perhaps the upper Gallery has lik'd their pictures, for <hi>Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skirk</hi>'s with the Mob, are preferable to <hi>Raphaels</hi> or <hi>Titians,</hi> but 'tis prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for the people of ſenſe and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be directed by the crowd in their taſte of Wit, or their favours on the Stage Writers. The multitude may at firſt not agree with the men of ſenſe, but tho the majority be for a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, 'tis their prerogative to rule, and their ſuperiour reaſon gives them a priviledge to direct the publick reliſh in theſe matters, with whom the Multitude will in the end certainly fall in. If the beſt part of the Town would
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98177:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no longer encourge illiterate Writers, but take ſome care that they may be ſilenc'd and not ſtarv'd, the men of Wit would then be proud to pleaſe them. Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Mother of the moſt excellent productions, would bring forth many more pleaſant and inſtructive things than we can expect, while Whim and Ribaldry are applauded, and thoſe who write for the Theatre keep ſuch bad Company. This is certain, no Poet ever err'd againſt Manners or Religion, but 'twas at the expence of his Art; thoſe who know nothing of it can't help erring, for which reaſon they are not to be endur'd. But the Maſters of the Science will obſerve its precepts which them confine, never to pleaſe, but in order to inſtruct. A Reformation in this is neceſſary, which time only muſt accompliſh, for mens underſtandings are not like their actions, ſubject to Laws, nor any other diſcipline than Reproof and Satyr. The Farce-makers are in a fair way to impoſe on the Town no longer. There are more good Judges in Poetry and Muſick now than there ever were in <hi>England.</hi> Wit declines in all the Southern Nations of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98177:92"/>
                  <hi>Europe,</hi> where it flouriſh'd long before it came to any perfection with us. The Dramatical pieces which are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Foreign Theatres, will hardly even at <hi>Paris</hi> get credit with the Preſs. And 'twould be Northern po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to forbid an Art which we poſſeſs almoſt in perfection, at leaſt in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful degree above our Neighbours, tho they are by their Climates born to excel us. I have told you what I think of the Stage, and if Mr <hi>Collier</hi> can help to correct its errors on theſe accounts, I'll anſwer for t, that he ſhall have no reaſon to complain on any other.</p>

               <p>I had an opportunity to ſpeak ſomething on this yeſterday, and I was abſolutely of your opinion, that 'tis only thoſe whoſe Wit is as ſcandalous to the Stage as their Manners, who promote the diſorders we find in our Drama. 'Tis true, ſome men of better ſenſe have deſcended to follow them in many things, which the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Pit, Box, and Gallery has giv'n ſucceſs to. But theſe Gentlemen have bluſht at their own good Fortune, and been aſham'd to be applauded on thoſe terms; applauſe is yet ſo charming,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98177:92"/>
that there are few who would not pleaſe on any. The Rants and things which have been out of nature in our beſt Plays, are thoſe places which are moſt clapt, the caprice of the Audience has put the Poets on ſeeking for variety to the diſadvantage of their Art, and taking a liberty unknown to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Horace</hi> their Maſters. Good Wits will be glad to find the Town inclinable to be diverted regularly, 'tis as eaſie for them to give their Audience an inoffenſive Entertainment as the contrary. My Lord <hi>Ruſcommon</hi> has laid it down for a Maxim in Poetry, that
<q>Want of decency is want of ſenſe.</q>
And none will preſume to affirm that any thing ſpoken againſt Religion is not indecent. The burleſquing Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and ridiculing ſacred things, ſwearing, wanton actions and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and moſt of Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt our Plays, fall under this Charge. They are all the height of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency where the objections are juſt, and when the evil is wrapt up in a double meaning, the hurt is the more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98177:93"/>
wherefore <hi>Montaign</hi> is for being plain in all caſes, the fineſs of the turn, makes the Ladies ſometimes liſten to a paſſage, which had otherwiſe frighted 'em, and they had ſtartled at its being nam'd; but a Pill is nevertheleſs nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for being gilded, it only qualifies its appearance, and makes it the eaſier to be ſwallow'd. I don't ſay thus much to inſinuate my ſelf into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of Mr <hi>Collier</hi> or his Advocates. I am not the firſt that made this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, neither is the honour of finding out the liberty of the Stage Writers, to be attributed to the Author of the <hi>Short View.</hi> Many hundreds had in common converſation ſaid more to the purpoſe before he <hi>broke ſilence,</hi> only they had not given themſelves the trouble to put their thoughts into ſuch pert Sentences, and divided 'em into Chapters; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their did they think it neceſſary to accuſe the Stage or its authors, of Crimes which they are not guilty of, as he has done. They charg'd ſome things on the folly of the Poets, and ſome things on the licentiouſneſs of the Age. The Poets ever follow'd the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the times. In this they have been
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98177:93"/>
too faulty. They ought to obſerve in what that humour is irregular, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it, wherein our Comedies, as bad as they are, have in ſome meaſure been ſerviceable. The Age was running mad after the foppery of the <hi>French</hi> Court, which made abundance of young Fellows ſtudy how to ontvie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one another in tawdry and vanity Fops have been the continual ſport of the Theatre, and the name of <hi>Bean,</hi> which was once us'd as a Title of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is enough now to draw the Sparks Sword out of its Scabbard, as willing as it may be to ſtay there. Manners have been much better'd in this point, by the tricks thoſe Monkeys in the form of men have play'd on the Stage. Affectation, the ruin of the beſt endowments, has grown out of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and nature been made the ſtandard of our words and actions. There is nothing more ſcandalous, than to ſtand out againſt this reproof, and we can hardly meet with a Coxcomb daring enough to play his fools part in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſince his Coat has been ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully colour'd by the Poets red and yellow. The Grave Sages who are wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98177:94"/>
to their Bands and Trunk-breeches, are as little oblig'd to 'em as the <hi>Beaus,</hi> but they think a Reformation in Cloaths of no great conſequence, and ſo perhaps will moſt who ſhall hear this argument. It will ſeem trivial at firſt, but when we conſider of what importance the moſt wiſe and moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent States have thought irregularity in dreſs, what Edicts were publiſht by the <hi>Spartan</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealths, how many Judgments have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd in Scripture againſt wanton or ſuperfluous habits; and how many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in all Languages have been preacht on this ſubject, we ſhall not have ſo little opinion of the good our Comedies do in this particular, as ſome men may fancy; they have brought us to a decency in apparel, which, without it, I believe could have hardly been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd by the ſeverity of a Law: For this has made us willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like men. We have ſeen, and been convinc'd, of the weakneſs of the <hi>French</hi> in valuing themſelves on their Ribbonds and Feathers, and by common conſent are reduc'd to the moſt modeſt habit in the world; ſo much might be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98177:94"/>
ſaid, and a great deal more for the preſent Stage. But ſince 'tis requiſite, it ſhould be regulated, and eaſie to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, we'll not think of pretending to keep it on its preſent eſtabliſhment, unleſs it could not be brought into better order, which is both feaſible and convenient. I muſt confeſs I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have this Stage than none at all; for I am in hopes that ill Plays and ill Writers will be put out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance more and more every day, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Author of <hi>Love for Love,</hi> who is giving the world a new Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhall continue to write, or ſome other great Genius take up the Quarrel with Vice and Folly.</p>

               <p>Moſt certainly.

<q>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:98177:95"/>Tragedy, he ſays, rectifies the uſe of the paſſions, by moderating Terrour and Pity, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles to Virtue. It teaches mankind that Vice never goes unpuniſh'd; in repreſenting a wicked man, ſuch as <hi>Egiſtheus in the Electra of Sophocles,</hi> puniſh'd for his Crimes, after he had for ſeveral years glory'd in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. It ſhews us, that the favours of Fortune, and worldly Grandeur, are not real bleſſings, when we ſee an unfortunate Queen, like the <hi>Hecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba of Euripides,</hi> lamenting her Condition in the moſt mournful accents. Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is the image of common Converſation, corrects publick defects, by ſhewing the ridiculouſneſs of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. <hi>Ariſtophanes in his Harranguers,</hi> was merry with the fooliſh vanity of <hi>Praxagora,</hi> only to cure other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their vanity; and <hi>Plautus</hi> had no other deſign in expoſing the falſe bravery of a Braggo-docio, in his <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Soldier,</hi> but to let the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers ſee in what true Valour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.</q>
Thus ſays our Author, and let any one judge then if the Drama is dangerous in it ſelf: There can be no

pretence that the Plays of the Ancients were more inſtructive than ours, at leaſt I'm ſure their Comedies were not; and the beſt of 'em to be repreſented on our Stage, would make but an inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid entertainment. The Ancients, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> have left very few reflections on Comedy, either they did not admire that ſort of writing ſo much as we do, or elſe the Ridiculous was not brought to ſuch perfection as the Modern <hi>Italians, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have given it, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> much more than either of 'em, or the <hi>Latin</hi> Comick Poets. If our Authors are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd by <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> in ſome things, they have the advantage of 'em in more Humour which was in a great degree unknown to the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, is the peculiar Talent of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and this is the moſt agreeable, and perhaps the moſt uſeful part of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Yet tho the <hi>Latins</hi> were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this their notion of Comedy was quite different from the wiſe men of theſe times. <hi>Comaedia mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum profuit civitati: cum caveret unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſque Culpam, ne ſpectaculo caeteris eſſet,

The <hi>French</hi> fancy they are particular<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly happy in moving Pity in their Tragedies, yet this paſſion has appear'd on our Stage as lively, as ever <hi>Racine</hi> brought it on theirs. <hi>Otway</hi>'s <hi>Venice Preſerv'd,</hi> and <hi>Orphan,</hi> part of <hi>Lee</hi>'s <hi>Brutus,</hi> ſome ſcenes of Mr <hi>Southern</hi>'s <hi>Fatal Marriage,</hi> and part of the <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bride,</hi> are examples of as penetrating tenderneſs as any we can find in the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renice</hi> or <hi>Bajazet,</hi> or, in ſhort, in the beſt of <hi>Racine</hi>'s pieces, who is moſt excellent when he is touching that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

               <p>I am very willing it ſhould be amended, provided the Alterations will not ſhake its foundation. I believe it may be put into a good method by thoſe who have the care on't. If their Maſters obſerve them more curiouſly for the future. Any other project for their regulation will be as fatal to 'em, as projects are generally to the Affairs of the publick, good for nothing but to put things into confuſion. I am told the men ought to ſit in one place and the women in another, that no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould dare to appear at the Play-houſe with a Mask on, that a part of their profits ſhould go to the poor, and that a Box ſhould be ſet up there as in the <hi>French</hi> Churches. The Actors ſhould live like Monks under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of a Governour, and the Actreſſes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98177:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
talk thro Grates like ſo many Siſters, and that it ſhould be criminal in them to ſpeak to any out of their Cue. Theſe are fair notions, and become the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Reformers who can find faulst, but make more in amending 'em. When our Plays are better writ, the people of both Sexes will find little time for their intrigues. Ill women won't have patience to do pennance three hours, for the ſake of picking up a Cully. They'll not endure to ſee themſeves repreſented as odious as their Characters are in themſelves, nor ſuffer the laſh of true Satyr for a Supper and Coach-hire. The Theatre will be as terrible to 'em as a Houſe of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Ladies will then come oftner to the Houſes, and there will be no need of complementing the Masks to get a full Pit. Thoſe who make their Dialogues with thoſe Creatures, their Entertainment at the Theatre, will abandon it. When the temptation they had to come there ceaſes, and their places will be fill'd by men of ſenſe and honour, that can't now with pleaſure ſee the brutality of ſuch Blockheads treated ſo tenderly, as the Poets have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98177:100"/>
us'd 'em lately, to engage Company, and draw an Audience together. This change will come of courſe when the writers for the Stage ſhall keep up to their Art, and remember that they are not to pleaſe but in order to inſtruct. Religious Aſſemblies will be then as fair an opportunity for the diſorderly aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of ill women, as the Pit or Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, eſpecially if Churches and Meeting-houſes are frequented by 'em now for thoſe ends, which I ſuppoſe is too well known to be queſtion'd. If women will after this wear their Vizards at the Play-houſe, why may'nt they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to do ſo there as well as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and to take away that liberty from 'em, would be a point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which has nothing in it but the form of Godlineſs. You'll par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me for being ſo tedious on ſo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial an objection, which, if you will have it, I had rather relinquiſh than make more words about it.</p>

               <p>I know no more reaſon why the Actors ſhould thraſh and ſweat for the poor, than any other profeſſion.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98177:101"/>
Leave 'em at their choice, to be as charitable as they pleaſe, and this I will venture to ſay for them, that they give more away to their Brethren and their Families in want, and other good uſes, than any other profeſſion whatever of their number. Thoſe who would have 'em oblig'd to diſpoſe of part of their profits to the poor, ground their argument on a ſuppoſition, that they live a lazy ſort of a life, and their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs only contributes to our pleaſures. By the way, you may be ſure they know nothing of their buſineſs when they think 'tis a lazy Employment. I queſtion if a Threſher in a Barn waſtes himſelf more than 'tis neceſſary for a good Actor, or that any employ is more laborious than that which takes up the thought ſo much as it muſt do to learn, rehearſe, and act their parts, eſpecially ſuch long ones, ſo humorous or heroick as ſome of them are. If 'tis becauſe their buſineſs contributes only to our pleaſure, why is there not here as in <hi>Holland,</hi> a Box ſet up in every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to receive the alms of the good fellows who carouſe there. The heat of the Wine often warms their Charity,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98177:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and they hope to compound for their debauches by their generoſity to the poor. This is a very whimſical piece of Devotion. How many other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions are there, and perhaps manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, which are deſign'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our pleaſures, where there is not the leaſt pretence of uſe unleſs for the bread they afford his Majeſtys Subjects. And why are not the Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond-weavers, Feather-ſhops, Perfumers, and a hundred more trades I could name, order'd to ſet aſide a portion of their gains, to make the Church War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Overſeers merry, and buy ſome new Gowns and Badges for the neighbouring Hoſpitals?</p>

               <p>I am not one of thoſe that ſet up for reforming the Age, I find it difficult enough to keep my own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons free from cenſure, and if every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98177:102"/>
would be careful how they give offence to Religion or Manners, we might ſave a great many honeſt, well-meaning Gentlemen much trouble, and ſome ſelect Societies a vaſt charge to little purpoſe. Thoſe who are paid for the good they do, may ſtudy ways and means to reform the Players, and reſtore the Sobriety and Chaſtity of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi>'s Soldiers among the Army; for my part, I conſider I am only accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for my own errors. Thoſe that ſuppoſe they are to anſwer for the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of other men, ought to take care that the Age is as innocent as may be. Actors, as well as their Fellow Subjects, are liable to the Laws made againſt Immorality and Profaneneſs. If the Statutes were decently and impartially put in execution, the Players would be found as Governable as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. This is certain, their buſineſs is not of its ſelf unlawful. We have ſeen it prov'd, that the Drama is not only lawful but uſeful, of courſe then the Actors are no otherwiſe guilty than for the Crimes which their folly and looſeneſs draw them into. And what Society of men is there who can plead
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98177:102"/>
perfect innocence? Their temptations are not more extraordinary than other mens, unleſs that their men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men converſe behind the Scenes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, which may tempt 'em to too much liberty: This may be eaſily provided againſt by thoſe who have the charge of the Theatre. I believe Dancing-Schools and Balls have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht more women, and women of much more importance as to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, tho the concern of every Soul is equal, than all the Play-houſes in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> The favours which the fair Sex have thrown away on ſome of the Actors, and the countenance men of Quality have put on the Function, by allowing 'em to be familiar with 'em, have been the occaſion of the boldneſs of the men. They have taken up no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of honour from their company and books, which not being born with 'em, they cou'd not well manage, and have occaſion'd ſeveral Riots, that may be eaſily prevented; If Gentlemen were more cautious how they make an acquaintance with 'em, not but that there are ſome of 'em even now (when I believe the Companies are not the moſt innocent
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98177:103"/>
which ever were) who know very well how to keep within their Character, and make themſelves agreeable where-ever they come. The women are ruin'd by the fondneſs of ſome Fops to be firſt in their good graces, and fancying it a high honour to have the ſmile of a <hi>Roxana</hi> or <hi>Statira.</hi> Let the Scene keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be charg'd as ſtrictly as they can to ſuffer no body to come among their Players. Let the Converſation of the Stage be as narrowly watcht as poſſible; and think on what ways you will to make their men modeſt and their women chaſte: but if this is not preſently to be effected, let us not loſe a profitable and pleaſant diverſion, becauſe there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies attending it. You may by the ſame rule put down the Wells, and make <hi>Tunbridge</hi> and <hi>Bath</hi> a Deſart, if you'd keep up no places where 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men and women will intreague. Who is there that has any knowledge of <hi>Bath, Tunbridge</hi> or <hi>Epſom,</hi> that has not heard of many unaccountable things done there, and as long as the liberty of Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is general at the Wells or elſewhere, there will be Amours, till the Age is of its ſelf grown purer. We might name
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98177:103"/>
he meetings at <hi>Iſlington, Lambeth, &amp;c.</hi> but they are ſo infamous, that they ought to be treated like the Conſorts at <hi>Stepney</hi> or <hi>Moorfields.</hi> On the whole, if I were to give my ſentiments of the Stage, I ſhould not make any alteration in the form of its management as 'tis at preſent. I ſhou'd be for laying a mulct, or ſome other puniſhment, on thoſe who are faulty in their offices relating to't. The perſon who preſides over the examining all Plays ſhou'd be anſwerable for the errors in them, as much as the Licencers of Books were for what was offenſive to Religion or the State, while the Preſs was under their Juriſdiction. But as the ill conſequences of things brought on the Stage, which are injurious to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Government, are more dangerous than ſuch as are printed in the Books or Pamphlets which are publiſh'd, ſo the puniſhment ſhou'd be ſeverer than what has been laid on thoſe offenders. And the Officer in whoſe power 'tis to Licence or forbid any Play the Stage, ought to have ſome conſideration from the Poet for the riſque he runs on his account. For let a man be never ſo exact, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may eſcape him in the paſſions of a

Tragedy, or freedom of Comick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which may not every where agree with our duty to Heaven and our Neighbour. 'Twill be difficult for our Farce-makers to do any thing which this perſon will think tolerable, when he is himſelf narrowly obſerv'd. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe that know better are ſo much aſham'd of the weakneſs they gave way to, that there will be no complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt 'em for the future. I muſt do Mr <hi>Collier</hi> the Juſtice to confeſs, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Books have been the occaſion that the Town lookt nicely into the Theatre, and have thence been diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what they thought too vitious, which has deterr'd many from venturing there lately and ſet the Poets on their guard how they run into their former extravagance, or make ſallies from their art any more to pleaſe a herd of Fops and Scoundrels, whoſe company can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupport 'em, nor their applauſe give 'em the leaſt hopes of an eternal name. Their praiſe will change with their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, tho they will be conſtant to one character of folly and lewdneſs, which will never get thoſe who endeavour to pleaſe 'em any laſting Credit, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>You have convinc'd me Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of the unreaſonableneſs of thoſe people, who are perpetually declaring againſt the Stage, and I muſt own my ſelf of your opinion, that its preſent Directors may be as ſerviceable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards freeing it from Immorality and Profaneneſs, as any new perſon ſome would have ſet over it. I have quite another notion of the art than I had a week ago, tho I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inclin'd to believe my ſelf in the wrong, being extreamly pleas'd with Dramatical Repreſentattons. We have had a drug of 'em lately, Women and Boys have attempted to divert the Town. They have ſometimes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, which encourages every little Rhimer to ſtrut in Buskins. I am as much a Servant to the fair, as the moſt complaiſant, but they have never yet charm'd me on the Stage, unleſs with their Action. I could never compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 'em at the expence of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and love the Stage too well to flatter any one to write for't, that I think can't ſupport it.</p>
